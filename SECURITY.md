# Security Policy

### Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open GitHub issues or pull requests - this makes the problem immediately visible to everyone, including malicious actors.   

Security issues in this open source project can be safely reported to Stripe's [Vulnerability disclosure and reward program](https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe#disclosure-and-reward-program).
Stripe's security team will triage your report and determine whether or not is it eligible for a bounty under our program.
